## Description

This application is a resource dependency that deals with a case study in a monorepo, where I have a single structure and four other applications that run sharing packages from my package.json, they are a gateway and three microservices that run in isolation, one on each port . I also used [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) for messaging and the [@golevelup-nestjs](https://github.com/golevelup/nestjs)library to allow me to work with exchanges.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```
